                <p>David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                    students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                    statement that it was all their original work.

                    Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                    three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                    that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'

                    End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
                    and pasting to cover assignment work.</p>

                <p>
                    Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.

                    "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
                    as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
                    to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
                    the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
                    IE7.

                    'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                    should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                    present a talk on internet security."

                <h3>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h3>
                <p>

                    Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
                    with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.

                    "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
                    the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
                    lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                    stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                    instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                    front of a room full of students.

                    So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out
                    popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.

                    Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
                    'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
                    floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                    since been decommissioned.

                    Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                    and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                    she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'

                    And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                    shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                    their computers with care!"

                <h3>DOESN'T IT JUST WORK?</h3>
                <p>
                    Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has ways of
                    acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the point where it has
                    become a pastime consuming most of his leisure time. He now has streams of
                    people seeking repairs, advice and assistance.

                    "Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when they came
                    to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.

                    I said I could and asked what they needed."

                    The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and, since it
                    was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or instructions.

                    "I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!'

                    She hadn't, of course."

                <h3>MAKE MY DAY, PC</h3>
                <p>
                    Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes his story
                    proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
                    working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
                    was a local police officer.

                    "He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
                    tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
                    his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.

                    Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
                    took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
                    gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too.

                    It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early!"

                    This is the first we've heard of someone trying to fix a computer by intimidating it.

                <h2>Meeting the growing needs of the job market</h2>
            </header>

            <section>
                <h3>The evolution of the global job market represents one of the motivations at the heart of
                    the integration of programming in school curricula.</h3>
                <p>This motivation, widely promoted by policy-makers,
                    is essentially linked to the need to train more people with programming skills.
                    Indeed, technological knowledge, particularly in the high-tech sector,
                    has been driving economic growth in North America and elsewhere in the world for over 20 years.
                    A growing number of jobs require a deep understanding of technology.

                    This number of jobs is actually expected to increase in the coming years considering that data science,
                    artificial intelligence and decentralization technologies (such as blockchain technology, on which
                    cryptocurrencies are based) are becoming increasingly dominant areas of the economic sector.

                    Teaching coding from an early age could thus be a way to facilitate countries’ immersion and performance
                    in the digital economy.

                    Some studies also argue that exposing students to computer programming early in the school curriculum
                    could have a positive impact on the identity they develop with respect to this field,
                    considering that there are many stereotypes associated with it (mainly that “computer science is only
                    for boys”). In this respect, arguments that go beyond the economic benefits can be evoked.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Developing learners’ cognitive skills </h3>
                <p>Finally, the most commonly mentioned argument concerns the role programming would play in developing
                    computational thinking in learners. Defined and popularized in 2006, the concept of computational thinking
                    refers to the skills of “problem solving, system design, and understanding human behaviour based on the
                    fundamental concepts of computer science.”

                    Several authors argue that the development of such computational thinking would be beneficial for the
                    learners, as it would allow them to develop high-level reasoning skills that can be transferred to other
                    learning, such as problem solving, creativity and abstraction.

                    For these reasons, computational thinking is often embedded within new programming curricula, such as in
                    England’s curriculum, where it is stated that “high quality computer science education equips students to
                    use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world.”

                    The introduction of programming into the school curriculum could therefore have a benefit for all students,
                    even those who are not destined for a technological career, as they could benefit from computational
                    thinking in their daily lives in a more cross-curricular way.

                    It is important to note, however, that these beneficial effects for the learner, although widely discussed
                    and increasingly documented, still need to be shown through more research involving comparative and
                    longitudinal aspects. Hugo’s thesis project examines this perspective.

                    In sum, it appears that Ontario’s decision-makers have seen the potential triple benefit of youth learning
                    computer coding for the future. However, the major challenge now facing the Ontario government is the lack
                    of sufficiently qualified teachers to adequately introduce this complex discipline to students.</p>
